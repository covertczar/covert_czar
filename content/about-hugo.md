I have an aesthetically curated bio [here](https://text.tchncs.de/czars-blogs/about-me).
Almost written like a poem, but why not write another ~~decent~~ one!?

I'm Rithul, but if natives calls me it will be like "Rithuleeee" with a bit of shrug just because I'm from...  
Kerala, a beautiful landscape. Such a hostile place that 90% of the younger generation wants to immigrate. Yet kerala tourism YouTube channel never fails to deliver.  
Meanwhile i distract myself with art, music and chess and I share some of this delightful chaos on my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/s/mitigatehere).

I know English, Hindi, malayalam, C++  
Sorry I slipped.  
Usually I do microblogging in these languages on mastodon or argue with some bots on forums

I am an Expert in Unix systems. If i encounter any problems I'm capable of... **DISTROHOPPING**  
Theming the system to look like Weed OS is my go-to on my gnome desktop

I’m thrilled to have you here and to share a glimpse into my world of art, music, and tech. Whether I’m exploring the beauty of Kerala, diving into a chess game, or tweaking my Unix system, there’s always something new and exciting on the horizon. Feel free to connect with me and join in on the fun. Here’s to discovering, learning, and creating together!
